# ===========================================
# TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace ALL [placeholders] with actual values
# 2. Define clear event trigger and payload structure
# 3. Specify all subscribers and their purposes
# 4. Map relationships to related actors and processes
# 5. Ensure event follows pub/sub patterns
# 6. Validate using SOL extension in VSCode
